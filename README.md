# PHP SOAP Web Service Example

This repository contains a simple example of a SOAP web service implemented using PHP. The service demonstrates how to create a SOAP server and client, as well as how to use WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to define the service's structure and operations.

## Features

- **SOAP Web Service**: A basic PHP SOAP server that exposes a method to retrieve a list of users.
- **SOAP Client**: A PHP script that consumes the SOAP service and displays the results in an HTML table.
- **WSDL Definition**: An XML file that describes the SOAP service's interface and operations.
